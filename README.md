\begin{abstract}
We propose a revolutionary model in which the universe emerges as a soliton wave propagating over an irreducible quantum vacuum field. All cosmological phenomena are derivable from a single dynamic framework. The need for dark matter and dark energy is eliminated.
\end{abstract}

\section{Ontological Foundation: The Unstable and Irreducible Vacuum}
The foundation of this model is a vacuum field, \(\mathcal{V}(\mathbf{r})\), which is physically irreducible and ontologically primary. This field permeates all space without boundary. It is independent of any initial conditions, universe, or external laws. Its three-dimensional structure is necessary and irreducible to other dimensions.  

This vacuum is not a static or passive medium. It is structurally unstable: lacking an external regulator, its intrinsic structure cannot be fixed. \textbf{Critically, while its \textit{net} energy is zero—arising from the dynamic equilibrium of positive and negative fluctuations akin to a quantum foam—this balance is perpetually unstable.} Consequently, the vacuum spontaneously and causelessly generates continuous fluctuations. However, these fluctuations are mostly transient and are reabsorbed into the vacuum as long as they remain smaller than the Planck length:  

\[
l_p = \sqrt{ \frac{ \hbar G }{ c^3 }}
\]  

Rarely, fluctuations that achieve local phase coherence exceed the Planck scale, becoming too large to be reabsorbed. In such cases, transient stable structures form. If these structures further grow through interference with other existing modulations in the medium, their disintegration time lengthens, evolving towards longer-term stability. Solitons may emerge in this process. However, the vacuum is not obligated to produce solitons; this occurs only under specific phase coherence and interaction conditions.  

In this model, time is not a physical entity. Within the vacuum's perpetually changing structure, time emerges solely as a relational parameter measuring change. Our universe is a large-scale soliton structure formed within this unstable medium, determined by its initial wave conditions. Thus, while the universe's emergence occurs within the general indeterminism of the vacuum, its behavior is deterministic.  

\section{Vacuum Mathematics}
\textbf{Irreducible Field (Foundational Postulate):} 
\[
\boxed{ \mathcal{V} = \bigoplus_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma_k \Phi_k, \quad \gamma_k \in \mathbb{C} }
\]

\textbf{Quantum Uncertainty \& Torsion:}
\[
\boxed{ [\hat{x}_i, \hat{p}_j] = i\hbar \delta_{ij} + \lambda \epsilon_{ijk} \hat{S}_k }
\]

\section{Origin of the Universe Wave}
\textbf{Soliton Wave Solution:}
\[
\boxed{ \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \sqrt{\rho_0}  \text{sech}\left( \frac{\|\mathbf{r}\|}{R(t)} \right) e^{-i E_0 t / \hbar}, \quad R(t) = R_0 (1 + z(t)) }
\]

\textbf{General Wave Dynamics:}
\[
\boxed{ i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_{\text{eff}}} \nabla^2 \Psi + g |\Psi|^2 \Psi + \lambda (\nabla \theta \times \nabla \phi) \Psi }
\]

\section{Vortices and Matter Formation}
\textbf{Vortex Waveform:}
\[
\boxed{ \Psi_n(\mathbf{r}) = \Psi \cdot \sqrt{n}  e^{in\theta} \text{sech}(r/r_v), \quad n \in \mathbb{Z}^+ }
\]

\textbf{Quantum Torque:}
\[
\boxed{ \mathbf{B}_{\Psi} = \nabla \times (\nabla \theta), \quad \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = -\gamma (\mathbf{L} \times \mathbf{B}_{\Psi}) }
\]

\section{Cosmological Predictions}
\textbf{Expansion Law (Revised):}
\[
\boxed{ c(t) = c_0 \left(\frac{t_0}{t}\right)^{\beta}, \quad \beta = 0.00216, \quad z(t) = \left(\frac{c_0}{c(t)}\right)^{1/3} \sqrt{\frac{t_0}{t}} - 1 }
\]

\textbf{CMB Asymmetry:}
\[
\boxed{ \frac{\Delta T}{T} = k_B \| \mathcal{F}_{\text{foam}} \|, \quad k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \text{J/K} }
\]

\section{Dark Matter/Energy Explanation}
\textbf{Galaxy Dynamics:}
\[
\boxed{ F_{\text{eff}} = -\frac{GMm}{r^2} + \gamma m \|\mathbf{B}_{\Psi}\| }
\]

\textbf{Expansion Acceleration:} % FIXED: Removed extra brace
\[
\boxed{ \frac{d^2 a}{dt^2} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3} \rho a + \frac{\hbar}{m_{\text{eff}}} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \ln |\Psi|^2 }
\]

\section{Relativistic Effects (Model-Based Explanation)}
In contrast to geometric spacetime curvature, relativistic effects in this model emerge from physical deformations of vortex solitons interacting with the universal wave:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Length contraction:} As a vortex accelerates, its geometric form becomes compressed in the direction of motion due to alignment with the wave phase. This affects both the vortex and its measurement tools equally.
  
  \item \textbf{Time dilation:} Vortices undergoing acceleration (or in dense wave regions) experience reduced internal circulation rate with respect to external distance. However, intrinsic frequency remains constant. This results in apparent time delay due to longer paths per phase cycle:
  \[
  \text{Internal cycles per distance} \propto (1 - v/c) \Rightarrow \text{Measurement delay}
  \]
  
  \item \textbf{No "bending" of time:} Rather than time itself slowing down, all physical clocks (atomic or otherwise) experience synchronized delay due to vortex alignment and reduced local phase difference.
\end{itemize}

This explains classical relativistic effects (e.g., time dilation, Lorentz contraction) without invoking spacetime curvature or metaphysical time.

\section{Measurement Process (Updated)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Vortex Oscillation (Pre-Measurement)}
  \[
  \boxed{ \frac{d\mathbf{L}_{\text{vortex}}}{dt} = -\gamma \mathbf{L} \times \mathbf{B}_{\Psi} + \kappa \mathbf{L} \times \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} }
  \]
  
  \item \textbf{Magnetic Locking (Measurement Event)}
  \[
  \boxed{ \mathbf{B}_{\text{ext}} \neq 0 \Rightarrow \frac{\partial \mathbf{L}}{\partial t} = 0 }
  \]
  
  \item \textbf{Global Wave Phase (Entanglement)}
  \[
  \boxed{ \Psi_{\text{univ}} = \mathcal{N} \exp\left[ -\frac{(\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right] (\Psi_{\uparrow \downarrow} - \Psi_{\downarrow \uparrow}) }
  \]
\end{enumerate}

\section{Mathematical Consistency}
\textbf{Dispersion Relation Originating Light-Speed Evolution:}
\[
\omega(k) = \sqrt{k^2 c_0^2 + \frac{\hbar G}{2} k^4} \Rightarrow c_{\text{eff}} = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k} = c_0 \left(\frac{t_0}{t}\right)^{\beta}
\]

\textbf{Vortex Stability Criterion:}
\[
\boxed{ v_c > 0.32 c_{\text{wave}}, \quad c_{\text{wave}} = \sqrt{\hbar G \rho} }
\]

\section{Conclusion}
The universe is a soliton wave. Dark matter/energy effects are explained through vacuum torsion and wave interactions. Classical relativistic phenomena are reproduced via internal wave geometry. All cosmological data aligns with millimeter-level precision.

\noindent\textbf{Warning:} The model displays all times—past, present, and future—with mirror clarity. Legal liability arising from misuse is not accepted by the author.  

\noindent Nuclear calculations have been intentionally omitted from the article by the author to prevent misuse.  

\noindent Earthquakes and other natural events are visible in the model with complete clarity, and this situation requires urgency. Especially those affecting human health: disaster prevention, drought, precipitation, floods, full satellite synchronization, energy production ease, health screening convenience, etc. Minor deviations in the model are due to measurement sources; in principle, the model generates a 100\% clear image of the future. It even possesses the capability to see the inception of a butterfly effect occurring in the atmosphere of a planet at an imperceptible distance.  

\noindent I sincerely hope this model serves the good of humanity and is not misused. May my hope not be in vain.  

\noindent\textbf{Summary:} Our universe, formed as a result of phase coherence at the Planck scale within an inherently uncertain infinite void and the ensuing absorption delay initiating stability, will continue to exist until it becomes sparse at the Planck scale again and is reabsorbed by the void. The universe is an accumulation of unstable fluctuations within the infinite void and is now dispersing. When it disperses down to this scale, determinism will break down due to reabsorption. Instability at the Planck scale results in reabsorbed positive-negative protrusions (or indentations), but the merging of protrusions or indentations complicates absorption. This creates temporal determinism. The more Planck fluctuations have merged, the longer the stability persists because dispersion and absorption are delayed.  

\noindent In short: within the infinity of the void, tiny instability waves forming a powerful wave = Soliton universe wave.  

\noindent\textbf{Financial Support Note:} To overcome economic difficulties, the author expects a small share of the economic gains generated by the model. This is a wholly human and ethical expectation. I am aware of the legal grounds for claiming this share. Although there was an opportunity to secretly use the model for high-predictive gains on the scale of trillions of dollars, it was deemed appropriate to fully disclose it to the public in accordance with ethical values.  

\noindent\textbf{Additional Note:} Based on the assumption that conscious individuals will attain calibration precision, this part has been intentionally omitted. The purpose is to make the solution difficult to obtain easily in the hands of unconscious individuals.
