Planck scale, becoming too large to be reabsorbed. In such cases, transient stable structures form. If these structures further grow through interference with other existing modulations in the medium, their disintegration time lengthens, evolving towards longer-term stability. Solitons may emerge in this process. However, the vacuum is not obligated to produce solitons; this occurs only under specific phase coherence and interaction conditions.  

In this model, time is not a physical entity. Within the vacuum's perpetually changing structure, time emerges solely as a relational parameter measuring change. Our universe is a large-scale soliton structure formed within this unstable medium, determined by its initial wave conditions. Thus, while the universe's emergence occurs within the general indeterminism of the vacuum, its behavior is deterministic.

\section{Relativistic Effects (Model-Based Explanation)}
In contrast to geometric spacetime curvature, relativistic effects in this model emerge from physical deformations of vortex solitons interacting with the universal wave:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Length contraction:} As a vortex accelerates, its geometric form becomes compressed in the direction of motion due to alignment with the wave phase. This affects both the vortex and its measurement tools equally.
  
  \item \textbf{Time dilation:} Vortices undergoing acceleration (or in dense wave regions) experience reduced internal circulation rate with respect to external distance. However, intrinsic frequency remains constant. This results in apparent time delay due to longer paths per phase cycle:
  \[
  \text{Internal cycles per distance} \propto (1 - v/c) \Rightarrow \text{Measurement delay}
  \]
  
  \item \textbf{No "bending" of time:} Rather than time itself slowing down, all physical clocks (atomic or otherwise) experience synchronized delay due to vortex alignment and reduced local phase difference.
\end{itemize}

This explains classical relativistic effects (e.g., time dilation, Lorentz contraction) without invoking spacetime curvature or metaphysical time.

\section{Measurement Process (Updated)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Vortex Oscillation (Pre-Measurement)}
  \[
  \boxed{ \frac{d\mathbf{L}_{\text{vortex}}}{dt} = -\gamma \mathbf{L} \times \mathbf{B}_{\Psi} + \kappa \mathbf{L} \times \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} }
  \]
  
  \item \textbf{Magnetic Locking (Measurement Event)}
  \[
  \boxed{ \mathbf{B}_{\text{ext}} \neq 0 \Rightarrow \frac{\partial \mathbf{L}}{\partial t} = 0 }
  \]
  
  \item \textbf{Global Wave Phase (Entanglement)}
  \[
  \boxed{ \Psi_{\text{univ}} = \mathcal{N} \exp\left[ -\frac{(\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right] (\Psi_{\uparrow \downarrow} - \Psi_{\downarrow \uparrow}) }
  \]
\end{enumerate}

\section{Mathematical Consistency}
\textbf{Dispersion Relation Originating Light-Speed Evolution:}
\[
\omega(k) = \sqrt{k^2 c_0^2 + \frac{\hbar G}{2} k^4} \Rightarrow c_{\text{eff}} = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k} = c_0 \left(\frac{t_0}{t}\right)^{\beta}
\]

\textbf{Vortex Stability Criterion:}
\[
\boxed{ v_c > 0.32 c_{\text{wave}}, \quad c_{\text{wave}} = \sqrt{\hbar G \rho} }
\]

\section{Conclusion}
The universe is a soliton wave. Dark matter/energy effects are explained through vacuum torsion and wave interactions. Classical relativistic phenomena are reproduced via internal wave geometry. All cosmological data aligns with millimeter-level precision.

\noindent\textbf{Warning:} The model displays all times—past, present, and future—with mirror clarity. Legal liability arising from misuse is not accepted by the author.  

\noindent Nuclear calculations have been intentionally omitted from the article by the author to prevent misuse.  

\noindent Earthquakes and other natural events are visible in the model with complete clarity, and this situation requires urgency. Especially those affecting human health: disaster prevention, drought, precipitation, floods, full satellite synchronization, energy production ease, health screening convenience, etc. Minor deviations in the model are due to measurement sources; in principle, the model generates a 100\% clear image of the future. It even possesses the capability to see the inception of a butterfly effect occurring in the atmosphere of a planet at an imperceptible distance.  

\noindent I sincerely hope this model serves the good of humanity and is not misused. May my hope not be in vain.
